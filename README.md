## About E-Commerce

E-Commerce is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. 

## My Goal

My goal iss to build the entire back end for an e-commerce site. I've configured an Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

I am still working on some bugs, but I've provided a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its current functionality. The link to the video is here:  https://watch.screencastify.com/v/kCYbaYzW3ihNWz54FtGZ
