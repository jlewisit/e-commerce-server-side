## About E-Commerce

E-Commerce is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. 

## About the Project

I've built the entire back end for an e-commerce site. I've configured an Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

I've provided a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its current functionality. The link to the video is here: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/vVIppAVldnHmv0IbhcKW
